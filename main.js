// Three Bowls of Fruit
// 
// There are three arrays of objects containing .fruits and the .classification of fruit they are.
// The Chief wants all of the fruit put together into one place (hornOfPlenty) and wants them arranged by their type and then alphabetically (the Chief has OCD).
// The Chief always picks the fruit right in the middle, please give him (return) the fruit that is in the middle of the arranged hornOfPlenty.

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export let hornOfPlenty = [];

export function chooseAFruit(...args)
{
    hornOfPlenty = [];

}

// chooseAFruit(sunki, waban, aiyana);
